            <h1> About Me</h1>
            <p>Hey, this is my homepage, so I have to say something about myself. Sometimes it is hard to introduce
                yourself because you know yourself so well that you do not know where to start with. Let me give a try
                to see what kind of image you have about me through my self-description. I hope that my impression about
                myself and your impression about me are not so different. Here it goes.</p>

        <h1>Customer Review</h1>
        <p>We like to go to The Fairway every time we come to the Cape. The food is always delicious! This is the first
            year we could make reservations (probably due to spacing because of the virus). Our waitress, Casey, was
            great!</p>
